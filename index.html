      <h1><em> Thank You</em></h1>

<strong>Thank you</strong> for just being there.<br>
For watching TV with me.<br>
For going places with me.<br>
<strong>Thank you</strong> for letting me be me.<br>
<strong>Thank you</strong> for doing all of this and more,<br>
But most of all, <strong>Thank you</strong> for being you.<br>
It is you that comes to mind <br>
when I think of friend.<br>
It is you that comes to mind <br>
when I think of sharing.<br>
It is you that comes to mind <br>
when I think of appreciation.<br>
Because <strong>I appreciate you.</strong><br>
